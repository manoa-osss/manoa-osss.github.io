## Introduce yourself
Hi there! My name's Wyatt Hoodes and I am a computer science student studying for my
bachelor of science degree at the University of Hawaii at Manoa.  I am a
participant in the 2019 Google Summer of Code program with a really awesome
organization and loving every minute of it!  I have a lot of fun writing python
and javascript, but when I'm not coding I am either with my family or out in the
ocean surfing.  

So, *why am I interested in building communities?*

I came to the realization that there are a lot of passionate people who love
technology at my school, but they all kind of feel the same way: what you see
is what you get.  That is, there's not really a tech community at my school that
welcomes all walks of students solely based on their interest in computer science
and/or a passion for technology.  But I want to help change that!  I want to help
build an exuberant community, empowered by passionate individuals who want to
expand their technical skillset!  It would be a dream come true to see a new,
awesome, and welcoming community branch off and flourish at my University.

## Community definition
A computer science community that's a formally recognized student society under
the Association of Computing Machinery. The community has existed for many years
and has usually kept a size of 75+ semi-active participants.

## What are your community's shared struggles?
The struggle is that we lack a welcoming, open door, and open source community that
helps prepare students--of any major--to make a strong, positive impact in the
professional world by broadening their technical skillset.

## What is the mission of your community?
We provide the means and support to expand and cultivate each one's skills,
through the experience and philosophy of open source software!

## What do members look to get from your community?

### Activities
* Workshops - These could be events that help facilitate small "hello world"
projects ranging from git, various frameworks and languages, to software
engineering principles and design patterns.  These workshops would help people
gain an understanding of the material by getting their hands dirty with practical
experience.
* Talks - Events where individuals share their experience and knowledge.  The community
could arrange for both in-person and webcast discussions. These talks could range
beyond software, inviting anyone who has something they feel is meaningfully
related to open source.
* Hackathons - Help organize and run annual hackathons for the University, as
there aren't any currently!
* Tutorials -  Events that help introduce technical tools and concepts to complete
beginners.  These tutorials could be suited for freshman computer science students,
or just anyone who is interested in building up their technical skills.  These tutorials
could initially start as git tutorials aimed at building portfolio pages.  However,
higher difficulty tutorials could exist with appropriate disclaimers.
* Open-source-a-palooza - Bring the community together regularly to have fun
contributing to open source!  Social gatherings where people share projects, ideas,
or experiences relating to open source.  A great way to connect people and their
skills across different majors (with food of course).

### Communication
* The ACM organization has a discord that could have a channel added to it for
general announcements to students on the server (typically only CS students).
* I regularly contribute to Zulip, which is an open source chat application with
a really awesome mission statement and community!  We could run our own production
server for our school community, as they give out free premium benefits for cases such
as this! Zulip really provides a lot of the tooling needed for effective sync/async
communication!
* We could create posters to hang around campus to advertise our community, with
all of our means of communication.  We could disseminate this information during
events and meetups as well.

## Future proofing your community

### Agency
* Community lead (1 leader) - This individual would act akin to a lead dev.
This person would be the head of the organization; a passionate individual who
really loves open source.
Responsibilties would include:
  * Coordinating sub-groups of the commnuity to effectively work together and maintain
  a positive environment.
  * Gather outside resources, while being the "face" of the community.
  * Give talks, host workshops, tutorials, basically set the example!
  * Preferably be a GitHub Campus Expert.
* Organizers (2-3 leaders) - In charge of organizing and coordinating events.
Responsibilties would include:
  * Maintain the community calander.
  * Cater to requests for events and talks by delegating between members and leads.
  * Communicate effectively with members of the community and other leads.
  * Post announcements for all events and projects.
* Tech leads (2-5+ leaders) - Individuals who lead events and projects relating to certain
technologies, e.g., git lead, javascript lead, python lead, node.js lead, etc...
Responsibilties would include:
  * Be a passionate individual whose proficient in the technology they lead in.
  * Plan workshops and tutorials for all levels of students.
  * Be an effective, patient communicator.
* Treasurer - (1 leader) - This individual would be responsible for funding.
  * Manage event funding if necessary.
  * Coordinate prizes for the eventual hackathons.
  * Work to gain sponsorships, and help organize the monetary means to make
  various aspects of the community happen.

### Mission
Have our mission statement be our immutable mantra. Thus, as the club grows
and evolves, it will be doing so around the core values.  By keeping close ties
with open source software, the community will have a stable reference point to aid
in future proofing.  In this way, the community grows like a tree, rooted in solid
principles while branching and leafing out with each passing year.

### Structure
We design an off-boarding / on-boarding process, in which each role within the
community will have a timeline based on graduation dates.  So when a leader is
due for graduation, N months before we look for someone to fill the roll and
complete the on-boarding process.  At the same time, the current leader completes
the off-boarding process.  

The off-boarding process would involve:
* Hosting events/projects where the position is promoted.
* Posting on the community server about the change-over.
* Actively seeking out new talent and interviewing potential candidates.

Once a candidate is found the on-boarding/off-boarding processes intertwine:
* Just like at the workplace, basic training and introductions would occur.
* Attending a final event/project together where the on-boarding individual learns
by helping to prepare.
* It would be great to have the two leaders coordinate the next semester, as to
have the graduated leader come back for the first event that the new leader hosts.

These new leaders can be chosen based on referral and/or interview relating to what
they want to do.  For example a requesting Java lead could talk with an off-boarding
Java lead, or if none exists, demonstrate their skills in some fashion.  For Community
Leads, it would be awesome if we could maintain the GitHub Campus Expert title for all
new CLs!

This structure would help to future proof the community as the current lead, and the
oncoming lead would have their processes intertwine in such a way that the torch is
properly handed off.
