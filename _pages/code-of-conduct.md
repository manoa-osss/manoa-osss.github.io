The Manoa Open Source Software Society is a community made up of a mixture of students and volunteers from the
University of Hawaii student body, working on furthering the mission of connecting people in order to build technical
skills through open source software principles, regardless of one's background.

This document contains the ground rules that members of the community should adhere to.  This code applies to everyone
involved in mOSSs, be that leaders, members, individuals seeking help, people prospecting whether to join, or one time
volunteers.

This code does not exhaust all unacceptable behavior, but instead serves as the foundation for which the community
of the mOSSs is built upon.  A foundation that is built out of respect and compassion for each other, in order to
enrich the technical community that we participate in.

It is evey member's responsibility to help build a community that fosters feelings of inclusion for all individuals.

## Expected Behavior

The following is a list of behaviors that are expected out of all of our community members:

* Engage and participate.  This is the life blood of any community.
* When communicating, be considerate and respectful, especially in moments of disagreement.
* Before assuming there's a conflict, attempt to collaborate.
* Refrain from using demeaning, discriminatory, or harassing behavior and speech.
* If you see something, say something; If you see a dangerous situation, someone in need of help, or someone violating
this code, let a community leader know right away.
* Community event venues may be shared with members of the public; be respectful of everyone, you are a representative
of mOSSs!

## Unacceptable Behavior

The following is a list of behaviors that are considered harassment and are unacceptable within the mOSSs community:

* Jokes or derogatory language that singles out members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration
status, social and economic class, educational level, language proficiency, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and
expression, age, size, family status, political belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.
* Violence, threats of violence, or violent language directed against another person.
* Disseminating or threatening to disseminate another person's personal information.
* Personal insults of any sort.
* Posting or displaying sexually explicit or violent material.
* Inappropriate photography or recording.
* Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following (online or in person).
* Unwelcome sexual attention. This includes sexualized comments or jokes, inappropriate touching or groping, and unwelcomed
sexual advances.
* Sustained disruption of community events, including talks and presentations.
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the behaviors above.

## Reporting and Enforcement

Harassment and other code of conduct violations reduce the value of the community for everyone. If someone makes you or anyone
else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it to the community organizers at manoa.oss.society@gmail.com as soon as possible.

If a community member engages in unacceptable behavior, the community organizers may take any action they deem appropriate,
up to and including a temporary ban or permanent expulsion from the community without warning (and without refund in the case
of a paid event).

The nature of reporting means it can only help after the fact. If you see something you can do while a violation is happening,
do it. A lot of the harms of harassment and other violations can be mitigated by the victim knowing that the other people
present are on their side.

All reports will be kept confidential. In some cases, we may determine that a public statement will need to be made. In such
cases, the identities of all victims and reporters will remain confidential unless those individuals instruct us otherwise.
